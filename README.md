# Robologin

## What is this?
It is a project I've started a few years ago and never finished. It would be an automatic web backend brute forcer. I'm currently stucked with Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Tokens handling. I have a plugin system in my mind, but no code yet.

Need help for ideas, feel free to use the tool for testing porpuse, pull requests and open issues

Maybe with a little help I can finish this

## Example
```python3 robologin.py -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php```

## Need help for
- Testing (bugfixes)
- Coding
- Creating Wordlists

For any question, suggestion, open an issue
